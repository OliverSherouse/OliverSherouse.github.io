# [About Me]

I'm a libertarian-conservative policy professional living and working in the DC
area.  I earned my AB in History and Computer Science from Duke University and
my MPP in from the Georgetown Public Policy Institute.  My master's thesis on
tax salience and public pension programs is available [online][thesis]. I
specialize in entitlements, tax policy, the long-term federal budget, and
economic freedom.

In my spare life, I'm a [python] programmer and an open-source
enthusiast.  I have a few patches and scripts floating around the Web, and I
manage a few packages on the [Arch User Repository][AUR].

You can follow me on twitter [@OliverSherouse], or at [LinkedIn].
