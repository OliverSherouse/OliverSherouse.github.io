I am a policy analyst living and working in the Washington, DC area. I've studied both computer science and public policy, and I enjoy trying to mash the two together. On the computer science side, I'm currently particularly interested in machine learning and data science. On the policy side, I'm currently interested in regulation, especially its institutional causes and economic effects.

I use this site to write about those things, and whatever else I feel like. Anything I write here is my own opinion, and therefore my problem. My name in the URL, and whatnot.

If you feel so moved, you can reach me by [email](mailto:oliver.sherouse@gmail.com), on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/OliverSherouse), or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/oliver-sherouse/24/417/1a2). You can also see what code I've released to the public on [GitHub](http://github.com/OliverSherouse).
