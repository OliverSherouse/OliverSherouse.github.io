  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>

    This page shows a number of ways to track the spread of the COVID-19 virus,
    primarily in the United States. Because the US is larger than most
    countries both in population and geographically, it seems to me to make the
    most sense to compare US states to other countries. The source data also
    breaks out provinces in Australia and Canada; so those are included in
    these charts as well. China is excluded from these charts because its
    experience of the pandemic was somewhat unique and I don't think it makes a
    good comparison.

  </p>

  <p>
    Data updates daily from the
    <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">Johns Hopkins
      University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.
    I'll be updating the charts with new features and ways of looking at the
    data as I think of them and have time to implement. Feel free to let me
    know if you think of any features that would be helpful on
    <a href="https://twitter.com/OliverSherouse">Twitter</a>.

  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <h3>Are you an epidemiologist?</h3>

  <p>No. I'm a data guy, and I'm just visualizing the data we have for myself and
    anyone else who would find it interesting.</p>

  <h3>Isn't this data worthless because tests are unavailable?</h3>

  <p>It's possible, though the patterns at this moment don't seem artificially
    constrained to me. This is the best data I know of, so it's what I'm using.</p>
