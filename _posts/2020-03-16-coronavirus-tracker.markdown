title: Introducing the Coronavirus Tracker
---

A few days ago I started seeing a chart floating around of cases of the
coronavirus by country for each day starting on the day the country hit 100
cases. It struck me as odd to put the US on that chart next to, say, Italy
because the US could get a similar number of cases with small outbreaks in a
large number of cities that Italy had with huge outbreaks in a few cities. I
found out that the source data had subnational data, so I started putting that
chart on Twitter. There's been enough interest that I've decided to make a live
tracker[^1] with that visualization and others as I think of them. You can find
that tracker [here](/coronavirus-tracker).

    worst*? The more you know!
