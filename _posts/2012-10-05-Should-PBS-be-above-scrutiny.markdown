The [statement by
PBS](http://www.pbs.org/about/news/archive/2012/statement-presidential-debate/)
following Governor Romney's mention of it in [last night's
debate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck8fQ7TzQsQ) kind of ticked me
off.  It begins:  

> We are very disappointed that PBS became a political target in the
> Presidential debate last night. Governor Romney does not understand
> the value the American people place on public broadcasting and the
> outstanding return on investment the system delivers to our nation. We
> think it is important to set the record straight and let the facts
> speak for themselves.

Why on earth should PBS, which receives public support, *not* be a
perfectly legitimate object of discussion in a debate about how and
where the federal government spends money?  Every person who pays
federal income tax is currently forced to support PBS whether he wishes
to or not; why is this unquestionable?  
  
Social Security and Medicare were also talked about.  So was the
national defense.  PBS was, not "deeply disappointed" that those were
"political targets."  By implication, are they arguing that PBS is more
important, more sacrosanct than those programs?  
  
Obviously not, thought that's the logical implication.  What they
actually argue is that PBS is worth the investment.  They do so
poorly.  
  
First, they argue that the "elimination of funding would have virtually
no impact on the nation's debt."  This is true after a fashion; it's a
drop in the bucket.  But when your problem is too much water in the
bucket, you have to get rid of a great number of drops, right?  
  
Second they argue that PBS is at once so incredibly valuable to the
American people that they simply cannot do without it (the [apparently
taxpayer-subsidized lobbying website](http://valuepbs.org/) linked in
the statement claims that 236 million Americans watch the show annually
and that the channel is the most trusted TV news source), and also so
painfully under-supported that the end of the "modest" subsidy would
immediately mean the end of broadcast.  
  
Either it matters to people or it doesn't, and people vote with their
wallets.  
  
You could make other, better, arguments for publicly supported
broadcasting, but PBS doesn't.  And to frame the debate by saying that
PBS should be somehow off the table when the nation is \$16 trillion in
hoc and sinking is pretty darned presumptuous.
