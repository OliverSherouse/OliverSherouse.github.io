As is her wont, the thoughtful and provocative Cathy Reisenwitz has
written a thoughtful and provocative
[post](http://sexandthestate.com/jesus-is-still-my-homeboy-but-like-all-of-my-relationships-ours-is-a-weird-one/)
on her faith and how it relates to her social and political beliefs, and
the personal morality she espouses.  
  
If you read it—and you should—be sure not to be fooled by the breezy
tone or superficial flippancy.  Although, to quote the greatest book
review ever, “though we sense a sophomoric intent to raise the pious
hair on susceptible heads,” Reisenwitz is making a serious and
uncomfortable argument: that it is difficult to be both a Christian and
a libertarian in America today.  
  
Those of us who *are* both Christians and libertarians often feel the
need to explain ourselves in both directions, and in her post Reisenwitz
is doing a bit of both. To the libertarians she describes a problem that
I have simply come to call "Christian dumb"—essentially, that American
Christians are, as a group, doing a poor job representing themselves to
people who want intellectual depth. It's a real problem, and one I'll
come back to another time.  
  
For now I want to look at her libertarian appeal to the Christians, the
core of which I'll quote in full:

The point, as I take it, is that Christians should refrain from
“moralizing,‘by which take Reisenwitz to roughly mean telling other
people that what they're doing is a sin.’”  
  
Why? Because the knowledge problem—Hayek's essential insight that it's
impossible to make intelligent choices unless you have personal
knowledge of the place, time, and particular circumstances—means that
there is no sensible way to judge sin in another.  
  
Ergo, Christians should embrace the proliferation of personal
moralities, including, but presumably not limited to those of “a
sex-positive, polyamorous Anarcho-capitalist libertarian” (Reisenwitz's
description).  
  
But it seems to me that we're missing something from that picture.
Because if you believe in the Christian God, His omniscience is the
exception to the knowledge problem. God can, therefore, identify sin in
others.  
  
Now, if God kept His moral opinions to Himself, that wouldn't be much of
a challenge to Reisenwitz's argument.  But of course, if you are a
Christian you know that He has *not* kept his moral opinions to Himself.
 He has revealed that knowledge in some detail, with the Ten
Commandments providing a useful summary.  Thus Paul writes to the
Galatians:  

> Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity,
> sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of
> anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies,
> and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those
> who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit
> of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
> faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is
> no law.

Now I don't believe that this takes us into a conflict with libertarian
philosophy. Libertarians believe in moral truths, too, and even ones
that are recognizably followed or not followed by other people. These
are Hayek's “rules of just conduct”, and the principles we love to talk
about like non-aggression. We can certainly see when those are being
violated by others.  
  
Christians have clear rules set forth by an unassailable authority. To
be sure, there are circumstances where the application of the rules
isn't absolutely straightforward, and here Reisenwitz's appeal to the
knowledge problem is appropriate.  But there are clear lines as well.  
  
Is it the role of a Christian to talk about those clear lines to others?
Certainly it seems uncontroversial that one of the reasons we have the
Church is to encourage one another towards Christian lives. Thus Christ
himself says in Luke: “If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he
repents forgive him [...].”  Thus Paul says in his second letter to
Timothy: “[...] preach the word; be ready in season and out of season;
reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching.”  
  
There is, of course, lots of good discussion to be had about evangelical
strategy. But I think Christianity cannot be much advanced by emptying
it of its moral truth. And for a Christian, Christianity's primary
attribute is its truth, which attractiveness to non-Christians does not
alter in the slightest.
