Today I'm reading a few papers from NBER:

* [Cognitive Economics](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20834):

    "Cognitive Economics is the economics of what is in people’s minds. It is a
    vibrant area of research (much of it within Behavioral Economics, Labor
    Economics and the Economics of Education) that brings into play novel types
    of data—especially novel types of survey data. Such data highlight the
    importance of heterogeneity across individuals and highlight thorny issues
    for Welfare Economics. A key theme of Cognitive Economics is finite
    cognition (often misleadingly called “bounded rationality”), which poses
    theoretical challenges that call for versatile approaches. Cognitive
    Economics brings a rich toolbox to the task of understanding a complex
    world."

* [Austerity in 2009-2013](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20827), ungated version
  [here](http://didattica.unibocconi.it/mypage/upload/48751_20141110_105228_AUSTERITY-ALESINABARBIEROFAVEROGIAVAZZIPARADISI_SEPT.PDF):

    "The conventional wisdom is (i) that fiscal austerity was the main culprit
    for the recessions experienced by many countries, especially in Europe,
    since 2010 and (ii) that this round of fiscal consolidation was much more
    costly than past ones. The contribution of this paper is a clarification of
    the first point and, if not a clear rejection, at least it raises doubts on
    the second."

    I'm hoping that this paper on austerity will be a little more illumating
    than the fly-by analysis I was talking about
    [earlier](/ppe/2015/01/12/austerity.html)
