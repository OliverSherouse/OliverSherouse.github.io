title: Jon Huntsman's Conservative Case for Gay Marriage Isn't

A few days ago, former Utah Governor, US Ambassador to China, and
why-is-he-here-again presidential candidate John Huntsman laid out in
*The American Conservative* an argument that "[Marriage Equality is a
Conservative
Cause](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/marriage-equality-is-a-conservative-cause485/)."  

  

Now I don't want to get into what I think of Huntsman in general (not
much), but he's making an interesting claim, and one that's worth
evaluating: that support for gay marriage follows from a set of
conservative principles. So let's examine his case.

  

I'll skip over the bits where Huntsman talks about Republicans,
Hispanics, and himself, any of which you may find interesting, but none
of which have much to do with conservatism *per se*.  The actually
relevant bit starts here:

> While serving as governor of Utah, I pushed for civil unions and
> expanded reciprocal benefits for gay citizens. I did so not because of
> political pressure—indeed, at the time 70 percent of Utahns were
> opposed—but because as governor my role was to work for everybody,
> even those who didn’t have access to a powerful lobby. Civil unions, I
> believed, were a practical step that would bring all citizens more
> fully into the fabric of a state they already were—and always had
> been—a part of.

> That was four years ago. Today we have an opportunity to do more:
> conservatives should start to lead again and push their states to join
> the nine others that allow all their citizens to marry. I’ve been
> married for 29 years. My marriage has been the greatest joy of my
> life. There is nothing conservative about denying other Americans the
> ability to forge that same relationship with the person they love.

Ok, let's stop right there. The question of gay marriage is not about
love.   In the United States today, you are allowed to love anybody you
want as much as you want.  You can even buy a ring, have a ceremony, and
refer to yourself as husband and husband or wife and wife.  What's at
issue is a number of tax and contractual preferences in the law.  
That's not to minimize the issue—those preference are important—but love
has nothing to do with it.  
  
Don't make that argument and don't let anyone make that argument.
 Moving on:  

> Marriage is not an issue that people rationalize through the abstract
> lens of the law; rather it is something understood emotionally through
> one’s own experience with family, neighbors, and friends. The party of
> Lincoln should stand with our best tradition of equality and support
> full civil marriage for all Americans. 

> This is both the right thing to do and will better allow us to
> confront the real choice our country is facing: a choice between the
> Founders’ vision of a limited government that empowers free markets,
> with a level playing field giving opportunity to all, and a world of
> crony capitalism and rent-seeking by the most powerful economic
> interests.

> Adam Smith was not only an architect of the modern world of
> extraordinary economic opportunity, he was a moralist whose first book
> was The Theory of Moral Sentiments. The foundation of his thought was
> his insight that free markets and open commerce strengthened our moral
> fiber by reinforcing the community of shared and reciprocal economic
> interests. Government, he thought, had to be limited lest it be
> captured and corrupted by special business interests who wanted
> protection from competition and the reciprocal requirements of
> community.

OK.  So we have two principles here that he's working with: equality
before the law, and limited government.  Those are *bona fide*
conservative principles.  Do they imply support for gay marriage?  
  
Well, not really. Neither actually apply to the situation.  
  
Equality is the big one here. And the problem is, that gay and straight
people have an *exactly equal right*: the right to marry one willing
member of the other gender.  
  
I'm not being obtuse.  There is no right, for example, to marry "the
person you love."  If I love someone who's already married and wants to
remain so, for example, I can't.  If I want to marry a child, I can't.
 And when you try to ground this conversation in that kind of thinking,
those are the unpleasant places you logically end up at.  
  
What's being argued for here is *analogous preferences*.  Well, we can
talk about that.  But the argument based on the principle of equality
doesn't work.  
  
And the creation of those analogous preferences would also take away the
"limited government" argument.  That would be a social innovation by
government. You can argue that that's good, but you can't argue that
it's limited.  It's resistance to this kind of social innovation that
makes conservatives more skeptical of gay marriage than of other
violations of traditional morality.  
  
So what Huntsman makes is not a conservative argument.  It's not really
an argument at all; it's saying a bunch of conservative things, then
"gay marriage," and hoping people don't think hard enough about it.  
  
So what would a conservative case for gay marriage look like?  It would
probably have to go something like this:  
  

1.  Conservatism, by definition, looks at the world as it is, not as we
    wish it to be
2.  The moral consensus on the morality of homosexuality has collapsed
3.  Society has to deal with the unavoidable reality of gay
    relationships
4.  Stable, heterosexual marriage is the best model available for
    relationships
5.  Strengthening the position of the family in society, which is
    realistic and important, outweighs re-establishing the traditional
    sexual morality, which may also be important but is not currently
    realistic

The difference is that that argument doesn't depend on the false
proposition that straight and gay marriages are the same thing. The
former has been the cornerstone of human society, in recognizable form,
for as long as there has been human society.  The latter is an invention
of the last part of the last century.

  

Any argument that wishes away that distinction has to be fundamentally
anti-conservative.
