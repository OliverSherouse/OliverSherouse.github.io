title:  Redesign and Missing Posts
date:   2015-07-26

I've redesigned the site because I felt it was looking a little stale. For anyone interested this site is hosted on [Github Pages], using the [Jekyll site generator][jekyll]. I use the [Pure CSS framework][pure], the [jQuery javasript][jquery] library, and [Modernizr].

Part of the redesign means that my older posts have to be reformatted a bit. There are few enough of them that I've decided just to pull them all off and then go through them by hand. Some old posts I don't care for enough to bring back, but I doubt anyone will miss them.
