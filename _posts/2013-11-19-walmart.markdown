title: Is Walmart's Charity Bad?
date: 2013-11-19

Jacob Weissmann at *The Atlantic* flags a news story from Ohio about a [Walmart
that's running a food drive][og] for some of it's own employees who fallen on
particularly hard times.  Moreover, he notes that the company runs a similar
charity throughout its stores aimed at helping "Associates in Need"---employees
who have come across unexpected expenses or hardships, "including homelessness,
serious medical illnesses, and major repairs to primary vehicles.

Weissmann reads this situation as a rich company trying to make themselves feel
better by encouraging charity to the workers they exploit. His subtitle says
that the program is "proof that some Walmart employees can barely afford to
eat." The final paragraph of his piece runs as follows:

> Again, it's nice that Walmart has set up a charity so that its workers can
> lend a hand to their homeless colleagues. It'd be nicer if the company paid
> enough to make sure that wasn't a concern in the first place. 

I'll give Weissmann enough credit to assume that he knows that no company can
pay its employees more than they make for the company, and that these decisions
have to be made on a marginal basis. His story seems to be that Walmart chooses
to pay significantly less than marginal value, because otherwise you wouldn't
have employees who were one disaster away from destitution.

The problem with that story is that real wages for unskilled service employees
are relatively high right now:[^update]

![Real wages of service-providers are high][fredwages]

If Walmart's workers are getting severely underpaid right now, they can easily
improve themselves by getting a better paying job somewhere else.  But they
aren't doing that.

So here's a story that makes more sense: Walmart does a good job of taking
potential employees other companies don't want, and making them productive 
enough to earn a low wage.  It's hard to get a job if you struggle with
periodic homelessness, for example.  But you can get one at Walmart, and now
you're earning something.  How does Walmart pull this off? Some mix of
management and the nature of the work, I'd imagine.

But the point is, if you're pulling folks on or over the brink of poverty into
your workforce, your workforce is going to have a lot of people on the brink of
poverty.  Only now those people are earning a living as respectable,
productive members of society.

Where would these people be without Walmart? Unemployed. And if Walmart raised
its wages, they would probably be unemployed as well, [at least over
time][tam] (PDF).  Since those who are most vulnerable to economic distress
are likely to be those who add the least marginal value, you'll end up hurting
precisely the people you're trying to help.  Instead of working, they'll be
dependent on a mix of welfare benefits and private assistance.

Weissmann wants Walmart to pay people more than they're getting so that they
don't need to be as reliant on charity. I guess he doesn't realize that that's
what they're already doing.
