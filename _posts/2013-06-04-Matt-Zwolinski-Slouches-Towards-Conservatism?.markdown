title: Matt Zwolinski Slouches Towards Conservatism?

Matt Zwolinski is not a conservative.  He is, however, a libertarian;
more than that, he is the founder of [Bleeding Heart
Libertarians](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/), a blog dedicated
to the reconciliation of libertarianism and "social justice."  While
that quest is, in my opinion, probably hopeless, it makes for
interesting and provoking reading.  
  
Particularly interesting and provoking is Zwolinski's recent
[post](http://www.libertarianism.org/blog/libertarianism-without-rules)
on Cato's Libertarianism.org.  In it, he argues that ideas like utility
and the non-aggression principle are ultimately doomed to fail if
considered fundamental laws of the moral universe ("rules", in
Zwolinski's language).  Those concepts, however, are useful as general
principles.  The real trick is knowing which principle to apply at which
time.  Because there is no basic rule—or at least, not one
comprehensible to or articulable by the human mind—man must face "the
burdensome responsibility of exercising imperfect judgment in the
weighing of principles."   
  
So far so interesting. But the part that caught my attention was
Zwolinski's relation of principles to the underlying reality:  
  

> But while we can make our moral theory as simple as we wish, that

What we have here, eloquently expressed, is one of the basic tenets of
conservatism: that moral truth is not abstract concept that can be
constructed meaningfully for all mankind from the comfort of a clever
man's armchair.  
  
Zwolinksi himself
[suggests](https://twitter.com/Mattzwolinski/status/341608067873505282)
via Twitter (I love Twitter) that his adoption of pluralism is not
obviously more conservative than liberal.  But Zwolinski breaks from the
liberals (of the modern sort) when he appeals to the underlying "moral
facts" of reality.  Faced with the reality that he cannot find the right
rule, Zwolinski does not nihilistically abandon moral rules altogether
in favor of the rule of power and the General Will (which is, in
practice, the moral rule of the left).  
  
Instead he recognizes man for what he is (or ought to be): a seeker
after moral truths of which he knows only echoes and shadows but which
he understands is truly and fully real.  In place of the "super-rule" to
guide all moral choices he places Cardinal Newman's "Illative Sense."
 Russell Kirk would be proud.  
  
This still doesn't make Zwolinski a conservative.  If he starts writing
about tradition as the way that man receives and transmits the various
principles acquired through the cumulative experience of the ages, we
can talk.  
  
But for now it's just worth noting.
